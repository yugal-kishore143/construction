			This project is on making of a bridge. in this project we had to connect river Brahmaputra.<br> as you all know that Brahmaputra is a very wide river and it is difficult to make <br>such a huge bridge. over project started in 2000 and we completed it in 2005. <br>We completed such a huge project in just 5 years. this bridge has a capacity of <br>bearing 250 tonnes. For precautionary measures there is a security system which <br>calculates the present amount of weight on the bridge. <br>
